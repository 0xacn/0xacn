ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Andrew, I am a middle school software developer that is interested in open-source, devops, blockchain & startups ðŸš€.

I'm experienced in Python & TypeScript, but I've also tinkered with Rust & Go. I also love devops, and have experience in Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform & AWS.

I currently work at [Frenter](https://frenter.com), but I also contribute to open-source, and build a couple side projects here and there.
