### Hey, I'm Andrew 👋🏼

I'm 13 years old and I create software.

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working @ plr.me, and [HaaS](https://hackclub.app) - 📦 The app platform for @hackclub students.

## 🖥️ Experience

I've been programming since eleven years old. Since then I've learned a lot about cloud computing, architecture and more. I'm a huge fan and supporter of
best practices, a large amount of my projects have linting and CI. I also make sure to follow best git practices. I mainly
code in Python, but I am decent in TypeScript Java and I am currently learning Rust.
