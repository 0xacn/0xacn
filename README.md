# **Yo it's Andrew**

# Experience

I'm typically coding APIs, server-side code or other various stuff. However, I've been getting into smart contract development using Solidity recently.

Stack:

- Rust - I've used Rust for systems programming, and also backend development using frameworks such as rocket.rs.
- React - I use react for developing client side web apps.
- TypeScript - Used typescript for developing microservices, or other various backend code.
- Solidity - Learning Solidity to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. (*written simple smart contracts in this language*)
- Python - First programming language I learnt, used it for a bunch of various projects.
