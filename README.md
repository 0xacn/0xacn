👋 Hi I'm Andrew`🌁`, I am a highschool software engineer interested in cloud computing & infrastructure.

I'm experienced in Python & TypeScript, but I've also tinkered with Rust & Go. I also love devops, and have experience in Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform & AWS.

You can catch me on [Twitter](https://t.nijmeh.xyz) & the [buildergroop discord](https://discord.gg/builders), or the Hack Club [Slack](https://slack.hackclub.com) in my channel #cabin.
